# personal-notes
A repo containing a collection of my notes about various stuff will go. Whether be it programming, mathematics, electronics, notes I have on different media, anything that is worth including. 

Think of this repo as an open-sourced online [Feynman notebook](http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/) of someone... or something.

This'll be used as the repo from StackEdit (and it is already been overcommitted to death already).

To make this README.md not so useless, I'll link you to [my freebies resource list that is full of sites containing free stuff](https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/freebies-resource-list) and hopefully helps you in some way. Why not I'll link you one of the most [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) repos (if not, the most awesome, aside from [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)).
