# a-remote-repo-full-of-notes-of-things-i-did-not-know-about
...also known as foo-dogsquared's `personal-notes`

A repo containing a collection of my notes about various stuff whether be programming, mathematics, electronics, anything that is worth including. 

Think of this repo as an open-sourced online [Feynman notebook](http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/) of someone... or something.

This'll be used as the repo from StackEdit (and it is already been overcommitted to death already).

To make this README.md not so useless, I'll link you to [my freebies resource list that is full of sites containing free stuff](https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/freebies-resource-list). Hopefully helps you in some way. 

Speaking of resource list, here's one of the most (if not, the most) [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) resource list. It's a resource list... of resource list. "RESOURCE LIST"-CEPTION!

Also, one thing to note here, is that a lot of the markdown files have images inside of them encoded in `base64` so that each markdown file is complete on its own without the need for other servers. Since [GitHub-flavored markdown doesn't support base64 images](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/270) so you have to view the markdown files somewhere. 

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### What?
Yeah... I have that in mind too...

### How?
I take notes... but seriously, most of these notes came from my offline notebook, also known as paper notebook. Although, some of them are re-edited just to go for another attempt at explaining it.

### Why?
For open knowledge, only without the guarantee of precision and accuracy... üôÉ And also I encourage this kind of writing-everything-that-you've-learned-down-in-a-notebook-on-a-reformatted-way practice.

## How to contribute?
~~Wait, what?~~ It's a collection of my notes about anything and it is mostly intended for personal use. So...

If you want to correct me on things, just shoot me an email or create a new issue on the issue tracker. üòÅ
