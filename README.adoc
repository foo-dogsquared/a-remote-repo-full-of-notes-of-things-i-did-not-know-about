= a-remote-repo-full-of-notes-of-things-i-did-not-know-about

...also known as foo-dogsquared's `personal-lectures`

A repo containing a collection of my study notes about various stuff whether
be programming, mathematics, electronics, engineering, and anything that is
worth detailing over.

Think of this repo as an open-sourced online
http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/[Feynman notebook] 
of someone... or something.

This open study notebook uses LaTeX as the files to be used for my notes
so you'll have to install a LaTeX distribution to be able to compile it and view 
the results. I might consider using a CI server to automate that (perhaps) for 
my (and everyone else's) convenience.

== Details, details...

Here's a list of programs you should have installed on your machine if you want to 
use this:

- https://inkscape.org/[Inkscape] 
-- Recommend to always use latest version.

- https://python.org/[Python]
-- Specifically Python 3.5 and above.

- a https://latex-project.org/[LaTeX] distribution 
-- Personally recommend installing https://tug.org/texlive/[TeX Live] since 
I find it easy to install across various platforms especially with 
https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html[an ISO image].

- a text editor
-- Obviously. Just for reference, I use https://www.vim.org/[Vim] with 
https://github.com/lervag/vimtex[Vimtex] and 
https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips[UltiSnips] inspired by
https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/[this post by *Gilles Castel*].

Here are the top level directories you give the most amount of attention:

=== `notes/`

Where the notes is stored, obviously. Inside of this directory are subdirectories of 
subjects in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles[kebab case]. 
Within those subdirectories are where my LaTeX notes
are stored. 

Each subdirectory should have also have the following:

- A directory named `graphics/` where all of the images to be used 
within the files are stored. 
- A `.main.tex` file where it serves as the main file under that subdirectory 
and should result in a all-in-one study book for `<SUBJECT NAME>` with each 
subfile included as a part when compiled.

You can add and remove notes within but you also have to manually add/remove some 
lines in the `.main.tex` file which is why I recommend to use the LaTeX notes manager 
I've programmed which I'll explain in detail later. 

Also, you cannot compile the subfiles individually (in fact, all of the `.tex` files here) 
since it uses the style files from a separate directory and it'll cause an error. 
That's another reason to use the CLI program I've mentioned earlier.

=== `stylesheets/`

Where my custom LaTeX style (`.sty`) and class (`.cls`) are stored. It got its name 
since I'm primarily familiar with web dev't and it just makes sense (at least for me). 

Take note that the LaTeX files from the `notes/` directory does use packages from here 
but without referring to the relative or absolute directory. Compiling them normally would 
result in an error. The recommended way of compiling them is through the CLI program 
which will be the next bringer of attention.

== Simple LaTeX notes manager CLI

There's a simple LaTeX notes manager script stored in link:compile.py[`compile.py`] 
intended only for the directory. It is a CLI program that lets you add, remove, open, and 
compile notes easily. You're free to use and modify it for any other purposes.

Also, it is the recommended way of doing things around here since it automates the 
workflow process. 

=== Usage Examples

To add a subject to the `notes/` directory:

[source, shell]
----
python compile.py add --subject "<SUBJECT_NAME>"
----

You can also add multiple subjects at once:

[source, shell]
----
python compile.py add --subject "<SUBJECT_NAME_1>" "<SUBJECT_NAME_2>" ... "<SUBJECT_NAME_n>"
----

To add a note under a subject:

[source, shell]
----
python compile.py add --note "<SUBJECT_NAME>" "<NOTE_TITLE>"
----

Like adding subjects, you can also add multiple notes at once:

[source, shell]
----
python compile.py add --note "<SUBJECT_NAME>" "<NOTE_TITLE_1>" "<NOTE_TITLE_2>" ... "<NOTE_TITLE_n>" 
----

Even better, you can add notes under multiple subjects in one command:

[source, shell]
----
python compile.py add --note "<SUBJECT_NAME_1>" "<NOTE_TITLE_1.1>" "<NOTE_TITLE_1.2>" ... "<NOTE_TITLE_1.n>" --note "<SUBJECT_NAME_2>" "<NOTE_TITLE_2.1>" "<NOTE_TITLE_2.2>" ... "<NOTE_TITLE_2.n>"
----

OR MUCH EVEN BETTER, you can add notes and subjects at the same time:

[source, shell]
----
python compile.py add --subject "<SUBJECT_NAME_THAT_DOESNT_EXIST>" --note "<SUBJECT_NAME_THAT_DOESNT_EXIST>" "<NOTE_TITLE_1>" "<NOTE_TITLE_2>" ... "<NOTE_TITLE_n>" 
----

The commands syntax for removing and compiling is pretty much the same except 
they have the following additional arguments under the note (`--note`) option:

- `:all:`
-- Refers to all of the individual notes (except the main note) under the 
subject.

- `:except:`
-- Refers to all of the individual notes except the following note/s with the 
title (and the main note file). 

Nonetheless, you can still view the help section for more details.

== Some other things

I'll link you to http://freebies-hunt.netlify.com/[Freebies Hunt]. It's a website 
that is full of free and open content that ranges from books, software, courses, 
and so much more. It's also where I list most of my resources use to study since 
I try to study deeply as much as possible with only free resources (though, admittedly 
it doesn't really bear useful results; just go and start right away with any kind).

Speaking of resource list, here's one of the most (if not, the most)
https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome[awesome] resource list. It's a resource list... 
of resource list. "RESOURCE LIST"-CEPTION!

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

=== What?

Yeah... I have that in mind too...

=== How?

I take notes... but seriously, most of these notes came from my offline
notebook, also known as paper notebook. Although, some of them are
re-edited just to go for another attempt at explaining it.

=== Why?

For open knowledge, only without the guarantee of precision and
accuracy... üôÉ And to practice this kind of
writing-everything-that-you've-learned-down-in-a-notebook-on-a-reformatted-way
practice.

=== How to contribute?

It's a collection of my notes about anything
and it is mostly intended for personal use. So...

If you want to correct me on things, just shoot me an email or create a
new issue on the issue tracker. üòÅ

If you want, feel free to improve it (esp. the CLI program). It's here so why 
not go for it, too.
