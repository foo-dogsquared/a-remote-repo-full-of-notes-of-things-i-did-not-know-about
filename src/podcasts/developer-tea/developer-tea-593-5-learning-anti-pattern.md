# Main takeaways on [Developer's Tea #593 - 5 Learning Anti-Patterns](https://developertea.simplecast.fm/aeb7c2cf)

## Staying up late and giving every available time to active learning
- Most of us are amazed by the idea of someone who is very dedicated to learning, giving every time to consuming knowledge resources: watching a knowledge video on lunch break, reading a textbook after work, and just searching everything as long as they are teaching something to them
	- However, **giving every available to active learning** is similar (or the same) to cramming. We are packing our brain with multitudes of information all at once when the brain could only take so little of it to be able to take a grasp of it in any given amount of time
- **Take a break every once in a while** â€” with this, you are already practicing *spaced repetition* which is I believe to be a key habit when wanting to learn a new subject matter, concept, or information
- **Treat your brain as it is**: a physical matter just like how computers is an assembly of components: transistors, capacitors, wires, and electricity having to go through physical processes to create and interpret information
	- Our brain and its individual components like the neurons, synapses, and the like also goes into similar physical processes to make the learnt information stick into our mind
	- Integrating what I've learned from one of Coursera's top course, [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/), information takes time to be cemented into our brain; as the instructor, Barbara Oakley, mentioned, it is like a brick wall held by a cement â€” rushing through the subject is like impatiently waiting for the cement to fully harden and because you're an impatient person, you just build some around it despite the problem it will cause
	- When we think in a larger scale, it is like a foundation of a house which is important if we want to build further on top of it; having a wonkily-made foundation makes the entire house building to be completely messy, troubling, and at the worst case, difficult to undo (I said difficult, not impossible ðŸ™‚)
- **Also, don't forget to sleep**
	- Integrating another lesson from the "Learning How to Learn" course, it is said that having sleep is a way of removing toxins from your brain that can slow down cognitive and mental processes and causes tiredness and fatigue
	- While our body is at rest, recovering its energy to be used for the next day, our brain is actively working and processing all of the information on the background, sort of like working in *diffused mode* which is why some of us may have this "Eureka!" moment the instance we get up when we're trying to understand something
	- So yes, sleep is much more important than most of us thought; albeit seems counterintuitive but once you know the background processes of the brain during sleep, you'll be recognizing the power of sleep (of course, in moderate amounts)
- **Practice spaced repetition**. As said, it is a type of practice that simply iterates understanding of a subject or a concept in a time interval
	- Say that I want to understand a mathematical lesson; with spaced repetition in mind, I could practice and solve 5 practice problems every two days
	- But that's not all, if I understood and mastered the concept matter, I could make the gap of practice days into 3 days, then 5 days, and so forth
	- The incremental gap of days also leaves an opening for me to understand more complex subjects (but not too much, remember) while retaining my mastery of foundational concepts 

## Being hyperfocused on one specific thing
- Having focus is cool and all but having too much focus on one thing is another, it is said that hyperfocusing on one subject or one concept is detrimental since information such as the subject lesson or the concept we study are often used in parallel with other information
- **Instead, interleave it with other subjects**
	-Of course, make sure that the concepts are in relation with the concept that you are studying for
	- This also gives you a sense of contrast to compare its mechanics to other concepts or subjects
	- Another thing with this is also compliments the spaced repetition so at least we are being more efficient

## Waterfall learning
- This is referred by Cutrell (the host) as a way of learning by pushing all of the studying in one phase and testing in the other phase
	- This kind of practice is usually done in formal education wherein students are taught all of the needed information to know about the subject then given some tests afterwards
-  Learning should be about getting feedbacks, evaulating with ourselves, improving the process if it's needed.  Now that I think about it, it is similar to how the [problem solving steps introduced from the book "How to Solve It"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It#Four_principles)
- **Instead of separating it into phases: the actions in learning should be repeating**, as complimented and repeated from the previous bullet point: `STUDY` - `TEST` - `EVALUATE` - `STUDY` - `TEST` - `EVALUATE` to ad infinitum until you understood the lesson.
	- From the looping process, it should give you a sense of direction and progress, not just feeling anxiety or lost diving into the lesson aimlessly
- As said by Cutrell, **testing could serve as the best teacher **. Most of us know the saying "experience is the best teacher" but testing is also an experience. It could lead you to failure but that it should be a feedback of your progress, not an indication of innate aptitude.
	- Intregrating what I've watched from [a video from Freedom In Thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjBdcyueom8), failure is nothing more than a feedback and having that in mind can lead us challenging to understand concepts that our brain has no idea about

## Softball learning 
- I don't know if I got the term right, I haven't found that kind of term on Google search results
- The `STUDY`-`TEST`-`EVALUATE` process loop is good and all but like all things, everything is bad when not in moderation
	- You could do the looping process around a particular concept until you got it but it is not that effect (remember the first two anti-pattern)
